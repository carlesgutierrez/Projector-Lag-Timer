An app to measure the lag in a video projector (relative to an LCD screen or other monitor).

1. Run this app mirrored on a monitor (e.g. LCD screen) and a projector
2. Take a single photo framing both, with a fast shutter camera (e.g. a DSLR, or compact digital camera)
3. In the photo, read out the difference in milliseconds. If the numbers are hard to read, use the horizontal white line against the color coded list on the right.
